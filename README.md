Introduction
The Smart Weapon Detection System leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and OpenCV to identify weapons in real-time surveillance footage. The model is trained to detect weapons with high accuracy and reduce false positives.

Features
âœ… Real-time weapon detection with 85% accuracy
âœ… Integration with CCTV cameras and security systems
âœ… Reduces false alarms by 20%
âœ… Supports multiple weapon types (guns, knives, etc.)
âœ… Provides alerts for detected weapons

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
Deep Learning Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Hardware Requirements: GPU for faster model inference (optional)
